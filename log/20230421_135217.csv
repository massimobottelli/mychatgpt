2023-04-21 13:52:29,"To move all content of a folder and subfolder to another position in Linux, you can use the `mv` command with the recursive option `-r`. Here's an example:

```
mv /path/to/source/folder/* /path/to/destination/folder/
```

This will move all files and subfolders from the `source` folder to the `destination` folder. Note that the `*` at the end of the source folder path specifies that all contents of the folder should be moved, including subfolders.

If you also want to move the source folder itself, use the following command:

```
mv /path/to/source/folder /path/to/destination/
```

This will move the entire `source` folder and its contents to the `destination` folder."
